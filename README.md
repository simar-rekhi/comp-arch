# COSC2325: Computer Architecture

## Description:
  Each folder depicts a weekly project that caters to COSC 2325 Computer Architecture class. Every .asm file contains the description associated with its content.

## Implementation:
  Content of this repo is solely for the purpose of practice and reference. After downloading a folder, you can use the following to effectively work with the content: <br>
    1. In Visual Studio Community, add .masm as a build dependency. <br>
    2. Use the configuration: Debug mode, x86, then Local Windows Debugger. <br>
    3. (optional) Following week 5, where we start using the Irvine library, you might want to add your .exe files to the _Excluded Files_ section of your Windows Security System or even turn off Firewall for the time you are building these files. <br>
    4. Following week 5, you would want to configure several other steps to make sure Irvine library works seamlessly on your system. Makotto's video on [How to Setup MASM and Irvine32 in Visual Studio 2019
